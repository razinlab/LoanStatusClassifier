# Loan Eligibility Classification with Machine Learning: Data Analysis to Model Deployment
## Project Overview
This project predicts loan eligibility based on numerical and categorical data. It demonstrates proficiency in exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, machine learning modeling and evaluation.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
- Regression Modeling
    - Logistic Regression
    - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classification
    - Decision Tree Methods
- Accuracy Evalutation
- Cross Validation
- Hyperparameter Tuning (Randomized Search)

## Results
A boosted decision tree classifier performed the best being rougly ~5% more accurate than linear classifiers.

## Next Steps
Some possible next steps for a more comprehensive solution are:
- Code optimizations to eliminate redundancy
- Online learning
- Deeper per feature data aggregation and analysis
